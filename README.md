# Decline  

## About The Project    

Decline is an application intended to practice German adjective  
declension. The idea came to me because I couldn't find another  
application in this topic that works in this way. This project is still in the  
early stages of development. I am using Java, Spring, PostgreSQL,  
Typescript, Angular, and Tailwind CSS technologies.  


## Built With

Spring  
Postgresql  
TypeScript  
Angular    
Tailwind CSS
